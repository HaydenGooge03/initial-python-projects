# guess resulting number magic trick

# method behind magic is as follows:
# tell user to pick any number
# tell them to double that number
# tell them to add (x) amount to their result ** final answer will always be 1/2 of (x) ** can use any number
# tell them to divide by 2
# tell them to subtract their original number from that result
# again, final answer will always be 1/2 of the number you told them to add to their sum

print("Choose a number between 1-100")
num1 = int(input(" Enter your number : "))

print("Now double that number")
num2 = int(input(" Enter your result: "))

# number is always 1/2 of this number
print("Now add 6 to the resulting number")
num3 = int(input(" Enter your result: "))

print("Now divide the resulting number by 2")
num4 = int(input(" Enter your result: "))

print("Now if subtract the number you started with from the final result,")

print("The number that you are left with is: 3", end="\n")


input("Would you like to play again?")





# figure out how to make num3 be an even, random number between 2-44 and the result to be 1/2 of that random number

num1 = int(input(" Choose a number between 1-100 : "))

num2 = int(input(" Now double that number : "))

num3 = int(input(" Now add 6 to the resulting number : "))

num4 = int(input(" Now divide the resulting number by 2: "))

print(" Now if subtract the number you started with from the final result, ")

print("You are left with 3!")
